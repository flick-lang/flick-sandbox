## Roadmap to a working demo!

- [ ] Create simple but nice UI
- [ ] Deploy to AWS

## Other Todos

- [ ] Switch from gcc base image to something like alpine so that the container start up time is faster and size is smaller
- [ ] Create multiple users to isolate the read/write access of each user. Compiler user should only have read/write/exec access to flick, main.fl, main.o, main. Runner user should have exec i


## Quick Todos

None so far.
